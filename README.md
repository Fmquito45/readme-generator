  # Readme-Generator

  ## Description
    I built this project to help save time writing/creating a README file. In order to build this project I had to apply new skill sets that I’ve learned throughout the module. This is what motivated me in creating this project, to see it come to life and be beneficial to every project creator out there and help them save time when writing their README files for their own projects and devote more time working on the actual project. Most traditional method to building a Readme file would be to search online for the proper syntax  outline and have to modify it by deleting unwanted comments for the steps to follow and then having to fill things out on their own and find proper badges and links for the license used. I have built this project to save a coders time when they’d manually write their own ReadMe file. My project allows for a Readme file to be generated after running a command line in the terminal and haven  been filled out with the corresponding questions. Every input is automatically placed in a high-quality, professional ReadME file. And selected License badge and link are automatically built  into the file too. In order to build this project I had to apply some new skills sets to have it functioning properly. I had to first familiarized with the server Node Js to be able to initialize with NPM’s and be able to download dependencies needed to  ask and collect data from the terminal when users input their answers to the corresponding questions asked on their project. In this case we used Inquirer. I had to learn how to import data from a different javaScript file which had its data exported. Based on the exported data, it would consist of the generated ReadMe file where all the input was placed in the function. In order to get access to the data inside of the object I had to use template literals. I learned how to properly assign the corresponding license  information to the license selected in one of the questions and assign it with its own badge icon and link. This was later used to render in a function to be placed in the ReadMe file. With these skills applied I was apply to get this project to operate as it should and Generate a ReadMe file based on answered questions in the command line. This was a great experience applying what I’ve learned and being able to see users properly interact with it.
